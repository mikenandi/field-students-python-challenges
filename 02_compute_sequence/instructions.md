**Task Title:** Number Pattern Calculation

**Task Description:**

You are required to write a Python function that computes a specific number in a sequence based on its position. The sequence starts with the values `0` and `1`. From there, each subsequent number in the sequence is determined based on a fixed mathematical relationship between the two numbers before it.

Your function should accept a single integer input `n` and return the value at the `n`-th position in the sequence.

### Requirements:

- Your function must use recursion.
- You are **not** allowed to use loops (e.g., `for`, `while`) in your solution.
- You should handle the base cases properly to avoid infinite recursion.
- The function should be named `compute_sequence`.

### Example:

```python
compute_sequence(0) ➞ 0
compute_sequence(1) ➞ 1
compute_sequence(6) ➞ 8
```

Write clean and well-documented Python code. Include comments to explain the logic you’re applying.
