# Python Challenges for Field Students

Welcome to the **Python Challenges for Field Students** repository!

This repo is designed to help you improve your Python programming skills through various coding challenges.

## How This Works

- I will be posting different Python challenges and tasks for you to work on.
- All challenge instructions and guidelines will be provided in the **main folder**.
- Each challenge will have its **own subfolder** inside the main folder where you can find the detailed instructions.
- Each student is expected to create their **own branch** in this repository. You will do all your work and submit your solutions within your branch.
- Inside your branch, for each challenge, you will create a corresponding folder to submit your solution files.
- Make sure to regularly commit your changes and push your work to your branch.
- Once you finish a challenge, create a Pull Request (PR) so that your work can be reviewed.

## Important Notes

- Do **not** commit directly to the `main` branch.
- Keep your branch organized and include clear commit messages.
- If you have any questions or need clarifications, feel free to open an issue or reach out.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Create a new branch named with your name starting with prefix dev-<yourname> `eg. dev-michael`.
3. Read the challenge instructions in the `main` folder and its subfolders.
4. Start coding your solution in your branch under a folder for that specific challenge.
5. Commit and push your work regularly.
6. Submit a Pull Request when you're done.

Happy coding and good luck!
